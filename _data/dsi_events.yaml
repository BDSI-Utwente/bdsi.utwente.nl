- title: "Training: Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector with R"
  description: In this training workshop, organized by the Center of Expertise in
    Big Geodata Science (CRIB), participants will embark on a journey through
    the fundamentals of geospatial data analysis using R. With its excellent
    statistical capabilities and a huge package ecosystem, R supports
    transparent data analysis workflows with an emphasize on reproducible
    research. Geospatial R packages, such as sf, raster, and leaflet, enable
    complex geospatial studies and strikingÂ visualizations that facilitate
    gettting insights from geospatial datasets. Join us to learn how to use R to
    accesss, analyze, and visualize spatial data!
