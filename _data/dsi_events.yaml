- title: Mini workshop AI for Dummies
  description: The applications of AI are flying around our ears. Automatically
    generated job ads, personalised chatbots, deepfakes; we are hardly impressed
    anymore. At the same time, for many professionals it is quite difficult to
    make a concrete picture of how AI will change the field of work. Especially
    without knowledge of programming and statistics, it is not easy to recognise
    the potential of AI in your own organisation and think about it
    systematically with colleagues. To help you do this, this mini-workshop "AI
    for dummies" will introduce you to the main types of AI, inspire you with
    fascinating examples, and get you started building your own AI model.
    Together, we will then brainstorm on application possibilities of AI in your
    own domain and reflect on what risks AI entails. The workshop is intended
    for all enthusiasts without technical knowledge of AI. This mini-workshop is
    in Dutch!
