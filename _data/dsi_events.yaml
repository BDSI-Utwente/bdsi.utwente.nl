- title: "Training: Publishing Research Data with fairly Toolset"
  description: The FAIR principles require research data to be published with
    complete metadata and ideally shared at different key milestones during the
    research. However currently, data publication and sharing happen mostly at
    the end, and published data mostly lack important supplementary information
    and metadata limiting its reusability. On the other hand, regular
    high-quality data publication takes time and requires manual interaction
    with the data repositories.

- title: "Talk: High-performance Spatial Data Management and Analysis with DuckDB"
  description: DuckDB is a novel in-process SQL database system designed for
    analytical workloads that has been making waves in the data science and
    engineering community. Not only for its impressive performance, but also for
    its focus on ease of use and integrations with the wider data ecosystem. A
    key part in making this possible is DuckDB's flexible extension system that
    enable DuckDB to be used across different domains while the core system
    itself remains small and focused. One such extension is the DuckDB Spatial
    Extension which brings geospatial data processing capabilities to DuckDB's
    vectorized execution engine and memory model, allowing users to perform
    complex spatial queries and transformations.

- title: "Training: Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector with R"
  description: In this training workshop, organized by the Center of Expertise in
    Big Geodata Science (CRIB), participants will embark on a journey through
    the fundamentals of geospatial data analysis using R. With its excellent
    statistical capabilities and a huge package ecosystem, R supports
    transparent data analysis workflows with an emphasize on reproducible
    research. Geospatial R packages, such as sf, raster, and leaflet, enable
    complex geospatial studies and strikingÂ visualizations that facilitate
    gettting insights from geospatial datasets. Join us to learn how to use R to
    accesss, analyze, and visualize spatial data!
