- title: "Innovation in Robotics and AI: Working together for the Future of Work"
  description: "It’s a well-known pressing reality: many societies, including the
    Netherlands, are facing critical labour shortages across key sectors. In
    several areas, the lack of available workforce and challenges to job quality
    are leading to serious socio-economic issues."

- title: "Training Workshop: AWS Training on Cloud-based Geospatial Computing"
  description: Cloud computing offers immense potential for processing and
    analyzing geospatial data at scale, enabling faster and more efficient
    workflows with large amounts of satellite imagery, vector data, and other
    spatial datasets. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a suite of services
    that are particularly well-suited for geospatial workflows. This training is
    designed to introduce participants to the key AWS services used in
    geospatial workflows, such as EC2 for scalable computing, S3 for data
    storage, SageMaker for building and training machine learning models, and
    the AWS Open Data Registry for accessing geospatial datasets. Through
    practical examples and hands-on sessions, participants will learn how to
    design, implement, and optimize geospatial workflows using AWS while
    understanding the underlying architecture and best practices for managing
    cloud-based resources, including pricing.
