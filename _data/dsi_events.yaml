- title: "Training Workshop: Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data
    with Python"
  description: Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data
    science and analytics, with a large and steadily growing community. In this
    workshop, we will help participants with a working knowledge of Python to
    familiarize with the world of geospatial raster and vector data. We will
    introduce a set of tools from the Python ecosystem and show how these can be
    used to carry out practical geospatial data analysis tasks. In particular,
    we will consider satellite images and public geo-datasets and demonstrate
    how these can be opened, explored, manipulated, combined, and visualized
    using Python.
