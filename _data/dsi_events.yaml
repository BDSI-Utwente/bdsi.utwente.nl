- title: "Training: Introduction to Docker"
  description: This workshop, organized by the Center of Expertise in Big Geodata
    Science (CRIB), aims to introduce the use of Docker containers with the goal
    of using them for modern, scalable computational workflows. Such workflows
    are useful for ensuring reproducible research outputs. The participants will
    learn the fundamentals of containers, practice essential Docker commands,
    and gain hands-on experience in building and managing Docker images and
    containers.
