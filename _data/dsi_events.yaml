- title: "DSI's special Meet Up with LISA & CELT : the Launch of UT's new AI Hub"
  description: "With a lot of effort, CELT has built in collaboration with many
    UT-partners, an unique AI-Hub in our own Canca-environment : a platform
    where all kinds of AI-literacy related material is shared amongst peers.
    Think not only as AI as a topic we want to interweave in our curriculum for
    our students as so they learn how to use this technology wise and secure.
    But also think about AI as a tool to make your professional life as a
    teacher easier : an instrument supporting you in designing parts of your
    courses, saving you time in the assessments of exams, or other
    administrative tasks your former TA's might have supported you with."
