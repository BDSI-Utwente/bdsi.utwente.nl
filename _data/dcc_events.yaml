- title: "Big Geodata Talk: Geofoundation Models - Unlocking the Power of GeoAI"
  description: Geospatial foundation models (geo-FMs) are rapidly transforming the
    way we analyze and understand our planet. By leveraging vast amounts of
    satellite and geospatial data, these models provide a powerful foundation
    for tackling complex spatial challenges with unprecedented scale and
    efficiency. Similar to the role of large language models in natural language
    processing, geo-FMs serve as versatile starting points that can be
    fine-tuned for diverse applications, from environmental monitoring to
    climate adaptation. They significantly reduce the need for labeled data,
    improve the consistency of analysis over time, and open new opportunities
    for collaboration between science, government, and industry.
