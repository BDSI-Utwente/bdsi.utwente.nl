# Digital phenotyping, **complex**, or quite **simple**? 

## Datathon Challenge

- Using several common **bio-physical signals** from a wearable device
- **Predict** if the wearer is under stress or not

# Data **for** you, **about** you, **by** you

## Legal & Ethical

#### In summary...
- You can **always** stop without consequences.
- You do not have to participate in the experiment to be here.
- We’re gathering data using wearables.
- We’ll anonymize and pre-process this data.
- Anonymized data will be shared with all participants.
- We’d like to store and potentially re-use this dataset for future educational events.
- See the handout for further details and contact info.

## Don your watches! 

- If you're happy to participate in the experiment, fill out the consent form
- Hand the consent form back to **Anna** or **Karel**
- Put on the Empathica **Embrace+** smartwatch

## Wearable Biophysical Signals

- continuous measurement of physiological data
  - BVP, EDA, temperature, accelerometer...
- changes in mental and physical state can be measured
- different states manifest in different ways
- different people respond in different ways


## Workshops

#### Tuesday

**Data Wrangling**

- What is it?
- When do you need it?
- Why should you learn it?
- Applied wrangling: clean, reshape, explore

**Modelling II**

- Modern machine learning models
- Implications of model choices
- Finetune and improve datathon model
- Make a prediction on the leaderboard

## Datathon Competition

- You have until Sunday, 23:59 to submit predictions. ​
- During the week, you can submit as many times as you want.​

- Two data sets: 
  - training: labeled data to train with
  - testing: unlabeled data for submissions and scoring


## To the winners go the spoils...

- A trophy to display and impress your colleagues.​
- Admiration and adulation of your peers. ​
- Certificate for your CV
  - Everyone can get a certificate for participation
  - 0.5EC certificate for TGS available


# Please remain calm

- Try to follow along ​
- No talking

# So **you** think you're **funny**?

## Tell us a joke, then!

- you have **two minutes** to think of an **original** joke​
  - You can’t use a joke you already know (even if it’s new to us).​
- Everyone will **present** their joke up here
- We will pick people to present in a **random order**.​
- We will rate your joke on **originality**, **funnyness**, and **cross-cultural appropriateness**
- We will share the best and worst jokes on the **BDSi website**

## Sorry! 

It was all for **science**!

- You don't have to tell your joke
  - ::: {style="font-size: 60%;"} 
    Although you can if you want to! 
    :::

- We won't store, share or retell your jokes


# Coffee break

- Please leave the Embrace+​ on during the break
- Get a drink, take another cookie​
- Compare jokes with the others​?
- We continue in ~15 minutes

## What was the **point**?

- Create several differnt physical and emotional states 
  - baseline (introduction), calm (meditation), stressed (jokes), active, relieved (break)
- We'll gather the data, clean it up, and psuedonymize it 
- Data should be ready for you tomorrow 

# Thank you! 

Please take off and return the Embrace+ watches 

## Stress in Action

- A **real** stress experiment
