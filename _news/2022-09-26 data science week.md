## Recap
The week started with workshops in data wrangling, modeling and visualizations in order to introduce the various steps involved in data science. Additionally, these workshops supported the competition (datathon) at the end of the week.

This edition of the Datathon was focused on predicting house sale prices with of course the use of real data. We are happy to say there were 28 staff and students participating in the Data Science Week, and 20 new members of the Data Science Community.

## Datathon
We are extremely pleased to announce that this editions winner got the best overall prediction out of the 3 editions so far! All three winning teams received a weeks' supply of assorted chocolate, sweets, and gummy bears.
