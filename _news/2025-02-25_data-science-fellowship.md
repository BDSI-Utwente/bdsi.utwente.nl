The Behavioural Data Science incubator (BDSi) is looking for BMS research colleagues excited about AI and Data Science and willing to share experience and contribute to high-quality research at BMS.   

BDSI is introducing the BDSI fellowship, awarded to BMS researchers that are willing to attend monthly meetings where we update each other on projects and plans, explore the latest development in this fast-moving field, and discuss how we can share innovations and best practices with our departments and peers.

As a fellow, you bring your take on the latest developments, are willing to explore and demonstrate new techniques or software of relevance to you and take an active role in sharing your results with our community. In exchange, you get a network of like-minded researchers, see new techniques or software in action, and participate in the activities your co-fellows organise.  

If this sounds interesting to you, drop us a line at <bdsi@utwente.nl> with a short statement of why you want to be a BDSI fellow, or give Stéphanie van den Berg a call.
