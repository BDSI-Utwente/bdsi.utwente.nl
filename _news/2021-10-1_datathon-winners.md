After a long week of data wrangling, feature creation, visualization and model building, the first BDSi Data Science week Datathon has come to an end.

12 teams participated in the datathon, and over 30 more signed up for the various workshops throughout the Data Science week. We're extremely pleased with the interactions we've had. We've also learned some valuable lessons, and had some great constructive feedback for the next Data Science week. In fact, we're so happy that we're going to make the Data Science week a regularly recurring event!

## Datathon Winners

While everyone who has participated is (obviously) a winner, two teams deserve special mention;

<!-- !TODO: comments on the submission -->

### Amin Asadi

Amin wasn't able to attend the final session, but he was kind enough to record a video documenting his submission.

<div style="padding:62.5% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/622295144?h=2f2f8265af&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Data Science week - Amin Asadi"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Amin's submission gave the most accurate predictions, **and we .... XXX?**. Sadly, his submission came in slightly after midnight - and was therefore disqualified.

### Iris ten Klooster, Anouk Veldhuis, and Emily Bakker

Iris, Anouk, and Emily presented their submission during the final session. While their model is much simpler than that of Amin, they still achieved an admirable prediction accuracy. We especially like their attention to feature creation, and trying to understand and mitigate the patterns of missing data.
