*WHO:* I’m a computational statistician and data scientist at BDSI. I expect to obtain a PhD on adaptive learning environments in the coming months. I have experience with adaptive testing, large scale simulations, natural language processing and adaptive learner models. I’ve also authored several R packages, and have experience with Python, C# and JavaScript/TypeScript. I’m excited about the prospects of computational statistics, statistical learning and machine learning for BMS, and would love to help you leverage these technologies for your own research.

*ROLE:* I am a data scientist at BDSI.

*NEED HELP:* I can help you with data scraping, data tidying, interactive visualizations (e.g. d3.js, shiny), designing and performing simulations, natural language processing, statistical learning and machine learning.
If you’re at all interested in big data or machine learning, but don’t know what they could add to your research, or how to implement them, please do contact me. I’d be happy to discuss with you how these techniques might be relevant for your research.
