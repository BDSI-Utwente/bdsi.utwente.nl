_WHO:_ My background is in Human Factors research, which is about fitting technology to the human mind. In my present research I look into how people learn complex motor skills, such as in surgery or driving, in training simulators. Powerful statistical models are essential for my research. My conviction is that what has been called New Statistics makes empirical research more valid, more interesting and much better to report. Much of what I have learned so far, can be read in my book [New Statistics for the Design Researcher](https://schmettow.github.io/New_Stats/index.html). In my courses around the year, around 101 Psychology students learn to program in Python or R.

_ROLE:_ I am here to represent LDT (Learning, Data Analytics and Technology) group, which comprises the departments CPE, OMD, ELAN, IST and OWK.

_NEED HELP:_ The best moment to start asking me is before you plan your study. Together, we can look into your research problem and find a consistent and efficient research design and develop a statistical model upfront. Even if you ask me just to do the analysis for you, I will always make sure that you fully understand the process and the results. My favorite statistical approach is Generalized Linear Multi-level Models (GLMM), which is an extremely flexible family. Even if you have never heard of it, chances are good, that a GLMM can translate your precious data into real answers. If you, as a group, need a solution for a specific research situation (or you are just curious about New Statistics), we can organize a workshop or live demo, together.
