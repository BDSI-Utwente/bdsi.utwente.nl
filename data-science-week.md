## What is the Data Science Week?

Over the course of two weeks BDSi will organize a datathon and a series of workshops and seminars. In the datathon, you will compete with other teams of behavioural data scientists to solve a real data science case. BDSi staff will organise seminars and workshops throughout the first week to introduce the various steps involved in data science. These activities are meant to support the datathon, but are open to all BMS students and staff. Coaches will be available throughout both weeks to guide you when you run into problems.

The goal of the Data Science week is to introduce interested students and staff to data science in a fun and cooperative way, and help create a community of data scientists at BMS. After one week, the teams with the best solutions and most interesting approaches to the data science problem will present their work, and be presented with a suitable prize.

## Who can join?

Everyone related to the faculty of Behavioural and Management Sciences and their friends and family can join (although at least one member of your team needs to have a University of Twente account in order to sign up). You can join with friends, colleagues or even family. The event is open to both novices and experts, and everyone in between. You can join the datathon as a team, alone, or skip it altogether and only participate in the workshops. If you do join alone you can choose to be assigned to a team with other data science enthusiasts.

## What can I do to prepare?

### Get a team

First off, get a team together. The datathon is meant to be a collaborative experience where you work alongside a variety of expertises.

### Read the book (or at least pretend to)

The materials we will use are based on the freely available [Introduction to Statistical Learning][isl-book] book. If you're interested in data science, statistical learning or machine learning, this book would be a great place to start. BDSi also organizes a yearly [reading club][ws-asl] around this book.

### Install R, RStudio, and tidyverse

As a faculty, BMS has decided to use _R_ for statistical education. We will follow this example, and use _R_ and the _tidyverse_ packages in the workshops and seminars. If you do not already have a preferred programming language, you may want to install _R_ and _RStudio_. ModernDive has published a good [primer on installing _R_ and _RStudio_][r-primer], that also covers the basics of working in R. If you'd like to go further, we recommend the free [_R_ for Data Science][r4ds] book by Hadley Wickham - a name you'll encounter often in the _R_ community.

    Amin Asadi was kind of enough to record a video presentation of his
    submission for last years' Data Science Week - have a look!
</p>
<p>
    Amin chose to meet the challenge on his own, but you don't have to.
    In fact, the datathon is best performed as a group - so that you can
    learn from each other, and explore together. BDSi staff will be
    available to give you a helping hand if and when you get stuck.

## Schedule

The Data Science Week will start and end with a group session. You will be free to work on the case on your own schedule, and coaches will be available for questions and feedback throughout. The workshops and seminars are scheduled throughout the week, gradually introducing new topics by creating a baseline solution to datathon.

![data science week schedule](/assets/images/data-science-week-2022-2-schedule.png)

> <span class="small"> The above schedule is from the winter 2022 data science week, but future data science weeks will follow the same overall schedule.</span>

### Kickoff

After a quick introduction about BDSi, we will introduce the topic, and give a description of the dataset, and the problem you will solve.
We will also explain how to reach the coaches for help, and give a brief overview of the schedule.

### Workshop Data Wrangling

A 45 minute guided introduction to data wrangling in _R_, using the 'tidy' data principles. [Karel Kroeze](/team/#k-a-kroeze) will show how to prepare a 'raw' dataset for analysis, by cleaning, reshaping and mutating the data until it gives up all its secrets.

This workshop is also open for those who do not want to participate in the Data Science Week. You can find more information about the workshop [here][ws-tdw].

### Workshop Data Visualization

A 45 minute guided overview of data visualization using the grammar of graphics. [Karel Kroeze](/team/#k-a-kroeze) will explain the principles of creating and layering visualizations with _ggplot_ in _R_, and give a quick introduction to interactive visualizations with plotly, shiny and beyond.

This workshop is also open for those who do not want to participate in the Data Science Week. You can find more information about the workshop [here][ws-viz].

### Workshop Machine Learning

A 45 minute guided overview of basic machine learning techniques. [Anna Machens](/team/#a-k-machens) will take you through the basics of model fitting, paramater selection and hyperparameter tuning, ending up with a simple but effective predictive model.

This workshop is also open for those who do not want to participate in the Data Science Week. You can find more information about the workshop [here][ws-ml].

### Submission Deadline

After spending all weekend with your team fine-tuning your solutions, you will have to submit them before midnight on Sunday. That gives us a bit of time to check your models and pick a winner. In the mean time, you can practice your victory speech - or suddenly have a brilliant idea that it's too late to implement before submission.

### Closing Session

The teams that created the best and most creative solutions will give a short presentation about their approach, and there will be time to ask questions to the winning teams as well as BDSi staff and coaches.
