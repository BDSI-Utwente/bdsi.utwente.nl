Part of supporting data science in the long term is building a community of data scientists and researchers interested in data science. Within the community we can share ideas, questions, and expertise with eachother.

The BDSi Data Science Community is free to join for anyone affiliated with the University of Twente, or involved in a research project of the University of Twente.
