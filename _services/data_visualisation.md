Using abstract, non-representational pictures to illustrate data is a very complex task involving many skills: visual-artistic, empirical-statistical thinking and even logical-mathematical. We see evidence of visualisations every day, from news articles to social media shared infographics. However, most of these visual displays of data often fail to present a clear picture and to enable discovery, insights and analysis. Being able to tell compelling visual stories with your data is very important in todays’ data abundant environment. We can help you develop aesthetically pleasing and effective data visualisations for your projects, from the data structure to publication.

What we can offer:

1. Data preparation techniques for visualisation, from dot to story
2. Data visualisation software and open source codes (e.g., plotly, d3, gephi, dash, ggplot2, etc)
3. Workshops in basic principles of visualisations, fundamentals of communicating with data, visual and statistical thinking, tools and techniques for building visualisations
4. Interactive data visualisation systems - escaping the flatland of paper (adding interactivity to your data)
5. Building dashboards (e.g., R shiny apps, dash apps, web apps)
6. Visualisation theories for decision making
7. Fundamentals for displaying quantitative and qualitative information
