A lot of modern research in the behavioural sciences involves time-intensive and/or multivariate data, think of sensor data, combined with wifi tracking, eye-tracking, and self-reports. Analysing such data sets requires knowledge and expertise in methods that are suitable for such complicated data sets. We can help you extract meaningful insights from your data sets using sophisticated methods.

## What we can offer:

We can offer help in using the following data-analytic techniques and help with the interpretation of the results.

1. Models for time-intensive data
2. Multilevel models/linear mixed models
3. Bayesian techniques and/or MCMC methods
4. Predictive modelling
5. Time-series modelling
6. Multidimensional scaling
7. Item-response theory
8. Structural equation modelling (SEM) and much more...
