We offer a range of support for researchers looking to apply machine learning techniques, from the conception of new lines of research to running large-scale models on a high-performance computing cluster on campus, or in the cloud. 

## 
1. Models for time-intensive data
2. Multilevel models/linear mixed models
3. Bayesian techniques and/or MCMC methods
4. Predictive modelling
5. Time-series modelling
6. Multidimensional scaling
7. Item-response theory
8. Structural equation modelling (SEM) and much more...
