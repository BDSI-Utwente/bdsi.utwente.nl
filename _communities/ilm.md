Intensive Longitudinal Methods (ILMs) allow to study people's thoughts, behaviours, feelings and physiology as they occur in real daily life using either diaries, mobile apps and/or (wearable) sensors​. Measurements can be both active (self-reports) or passive (e.g., acoustic sampling, GPS, actigraph, HR).

ILMs are referred to by different names, including experience sampling, ecological momentary assessment, ambulatory assessment, real-time data capture. What all ILMs have in common is intensive repeated (or even continuous) measurement of a set of variables over several days, weeks, or even months.

Advantages of ILMs over traditional observational surveys or lab studies​ can be:

  - More realistic conditions (real-time and real-life)​
  - More precise and less biased measurement (no recollection bias)​
  - Insight into the relevance of fluctuations in variables and (changes in) context​
  - Within-person (micro-level) processes​
  - Temporal nature of associations​

​ILMs are increasingly feasible and popular in research due to the fast developments in and penetration of smartphones and wearables.
