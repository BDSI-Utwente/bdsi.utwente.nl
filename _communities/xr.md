Extended Reality (XR) is a term that encompasses Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and sensory technologies, creating immersive digital experiences that blend the virtual and physical worlds.

The BDSI XR Community aims to establish a collaborative platform for researchers and XR enthusiasts to come together. 

We plan to host regular gatherings and on-site visits where community members will take on data related challenges such as:
- Analyze user behavior, such as hand movements, gaze tracking, and response times
- Handling sensor data and neural data in conjunction with events in virtual environments
- Investigating the impact of sensory feedback (including tactile, odor, and sound)
- Analysis of eye movements in dynamic visual environments
- Representing multidimensional data in a 3D space

Our core objective is to use these data-driven activities to advance our understanding of XR technology and contribute to solutions that address societal, cognitive, and environmental challenges using XR applications.
