> All interconnected systems like the economy, the brain, social groups, enterprises or the internet share universal properties. With the help of graph theory and social network analysis we can uncover these properties, understand the spread of misinformation or emotions, find out who is in control of an organisation or how resilient a network is against external threats.

Network analysis is all about â€“ understanding the connections and relationships between different things, whether they're people, websites, or even molecules. It's drawing a map of how things are linked together and how they influence one another. 

The benefits of analyzing data with this method: 
- Visualize connections 
- Understand the influence  
- Detect patterns 
- Spot key players 

Together, we'll unravel the intricate web of relationships and uncover the stories they tell. Let's discuss, question, and utilize network analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the world around us.
