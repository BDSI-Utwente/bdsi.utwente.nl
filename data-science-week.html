    <h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Given a dataset about known sales prices for houses, create a model that
      can accurately predict future sales prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you to succeed to give good predictions, you need to figure out what
      the relationship is between SalePrice and the other variables. Such a
      relationship could be captured with a model. An example of a very simple
      model would be a linear regression model with dependent variable SalePrice
      and independent variable LotArea: the bigger the lot, the higher the sale
      price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this datathon is to predict the sale price for future sales.
      The team that gives us values that are closest to the actual SalePrice
      (the best predictions), is the winner. Predictions are made by fitting a
      model using the training data, and then use this model to make predictions
      for the test data. There are many types of models that you could use, and
      their performance may differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge is to figure out what would be the best model to use, what
      predictors provide the most information, and how to tune your model for
      optimal performance - all without overfitting to the training data.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the week there will be workshops for specific parts of this
      process, you will be working together with your team, and you can ask the
      other participants and BDSi staff questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're satisfied with your model, create a <code>.csv</code> file
      with your predictions, and hand it as well as the scripts and models you
      used in before midnight on Sunday. The team(s) coming up with the best
      and/or most creative solutions will be asked to present during the final
      session.

    <h2 class="mt-4" id="data">Data</h2>
    <p>
      There are two data sets. One is called <code>train.csv</code>. Every row
      represents a house sale. In the last column we see for what price each
      house was sold. The variable is called <code>SalePrice</code>. In all
      other columns there is other information about each house. In the file
      <code>data_description.txt</code> you can see what each column/variable
      represents.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second data set (<code>test.csv</code>) also contains information on a
      number of houses, but does not list <code>SalePrice</code>.
