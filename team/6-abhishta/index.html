<p><em>WHO:</em> I am Abhishta. I make use of empirical data to help businesses understand the need for investment in cyber security. I have developed methods to measure the economic impact of cyber attacks. This helps me to get a more straight forward view of how cyber attacks may damage the current and future revenues of an organisation.</p>

<p><em>ROLE:</em> I represent the high-tech business and entrepreneurship (HBE) cluster in BDSI.</p>

<p><em>NEED HELP:</em> I can help you with implementation of montecarlo simulations, web-scraping, data collection from social media, bigdata (sensor data etc.) analysis and selection of data storage/processing facilities.</p>
