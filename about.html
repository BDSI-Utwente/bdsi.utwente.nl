      <p>
        The aim of BDSI is to spark innovation and collaboration in data science that involves human behaviour: to accelerate and inspire data-driven research within BMS that uses statistical models, machine learning or simulation techniques.
      <br>BDSI will support researchers and promote good research practices in all steps of the research cycle:
      <ul>
          <li>data gathering and governance,</li>
          <li>model building, training and validation,&nbsp;</li>
          <li>visualisation and reporting.</li>
      </ul>
      We organise courses, workshops and networking events on these topics, and provide training in the R and Python programming languages
      on all skill levels. We support the writing of research grants. By building a strong community, we aim to connect researchers in BMS with each
      other, with other UT research groups and the outside world.
      </p>
      <p>
      BDSI is run by representatives from all BMS clusters. To know more about us please
