        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of BDSI is to spark innovation and collaboration in data
            science that involves human behaviour: to accelerate and inspire
            data-driven research within BMS that uses statistical models,
            machine learning or simulation techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            BDSI will support researchers and promote good research practices in
            all steps of the research cycle:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>data gathering and governance,</li>
            <li>model building, training and validation,</li>
            <li>visualisation and reporting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The services we provide can be categorized into three overlapping areas:
            research support, community building, and knowledge sharing. 
            We organise courses, workshops and networking events on these
            topics, and provide training in the R and Python programming
            languages on all skill levels. We support the writing of research
            grants. By building a strong community, we aim to connect
            researchers in BMS with each other, with other UT research groups
            and the outside world.
