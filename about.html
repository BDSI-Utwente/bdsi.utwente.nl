    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of BDSI is to spark innovation and collaboration in data science
      that involves human behaviour: to accelerate and inspire data-driven
      research within BMS that uses statistical models, machine learning or
      simulation techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      BDSI will support researchers and promote good research practices in all
      steps of the research cycle:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>data gathering and governance,</li>
      <li>model building, training and validation,&nbsp;</li>
      <li>visualisation and reporting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We organise courses, workshops and networking events on these topics, and
      provide training in the R and Python programming languages on all skill
      levels. We support the writing of research grants. By building a strong
      community, we aim to connect researchers in BMS with each other, with
      other UT research groups and the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      BDSI is run by representatives from all BMS clusters. To know more about
      us please visit our
