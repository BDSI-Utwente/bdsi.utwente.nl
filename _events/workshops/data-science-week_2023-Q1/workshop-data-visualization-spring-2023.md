A 45 minute guided overview of data visualization using the grammar of graphics, followed by a hands-on session to apply what was discussed to the Data Science Week datathon data. [Karel Kroeze](/team/#k-a-kroeze) will explain the principles of creating and layering visualizations with _ggplot_ in _R_, and give a quick introduction to interactive visualizations with plotly, shiny and beyond.
