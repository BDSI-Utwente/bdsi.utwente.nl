chatGPT is bringing massive disruption to the sector of education. It can write essays, answer exam questions or write code better than many students or educators, but it can generate misleading information.BDSi organises a short seminar about chatGPT and its capabilities with an ensuing panel discussion with a group of experts in AI, education and ethics about the chances and challenges that chatGPT will pose for research and education at the UT. The main focus will be on how to tackle the challenges for education, but weâ€™ll also discuss the opportunities that chatGPT can bring for students, educators and knowledge workers alike. Everyone is invited to send in their questions, or ask them live at the event.
