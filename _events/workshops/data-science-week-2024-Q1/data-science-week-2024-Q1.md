## What is the Data Science Week?

Over the course of a little more than a week BDSi will host a series of workshops, seminars, and practicals surrounding the Women in Data Science datathon. In the datathon, you will compete with other teams of behavioural data scientists to solve a real data science case. BDSi staff will organize seminars and workshops throughout the first week to introduce the various steps involved in data science. These activities are meant to support the datathon, but are open to all students and staff. Coaches will be available throughout both weeks to guide you when you run into problems.

The goal of the Data Science week is to introduce interested students and staff to data science in a fun and cooperative way, and help create a community of data scientists at the University of Twente, the faculty of Behavioural and Management Sciences, and beyond. After one week, the teams with the best solutions and most interesting approaches to the data science problem will present their work, and be presented with a suitable prize.

## Who can join?

### Staff, students, family, and friends

Everyone related to the University of Twente and their friends and family can join. You can join with friends, colleagues or even family. The event is open to both novices and experts, and everyone in between. You can join the datathon as a team, alone, or skip it altogether and only participate in the workshops. If you do join alone, you can choose to be assigned to a team with other data science enthusiasts.

BDSi primarily supports Data Science for the faculty of Behavioural and Management Sciences (BMS). Other University of Twente students and staff are welcome to attend (with or without their family and friends), as long as spaces are available.

### Some experience with R or Python

{% include card.html title_element="h3" title="<span style='color: var(--accent-colour, #008eaa);'>Some programming knowledge is required!</span>" content="

<p>You'll need to have a basic idea of either R or Python in order to follow along with the workshops and seminars. Materials will be prepared for R by BDSi and WiDS, and for Python by WiDS.</p>
<p>While we will do our best to introduce data science topics in the various workshops without relying on code, a basic understanding of R will make it much easier to follow along.</p>
" %}

<p>If you have some experience with other programming languages, you should be able to follow along with a little preparation. More information on installing and using R can be found in the <a href='#what-can-i-do-to-prepare'>What can I do to prepare?</a> section.</p>

<p>If you're new to programming in general or would like a deeper understanding of R, and would rather learn from one of our colleagues, the <a href='https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/code/'>Cognition, Data and Education (CoDE)</a> section provides <a href='https://canvas.utwente.nl/courses/4715'>courses and materials aimed at teaching staff</a> and <a href='https://people.utwente.nl/j.steinrucke'>Johannes Steinrücke</a> teaches half-day <a href='https://www.utwente.nl/en/ctd/courses/1897203/introduction-to-r-workshop/'>introduction to R</a> and <a href='https://www.utwente.nl/en/ctd/courses/1897245/data-visualization-using-r-workshop/'>data visualization in R</a> workshops for PhD's (and EngD's).</p>

If you're confident you can do the datathon in any other language (we challenge you to try in C, Fortran, [Brainf\*\*\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), or JavaScript), you're more than welcome to do so. Just be aware that we probably can't offer support if or when you get stuck.

## What can I do to prepare?

### Get a team

First off, get a team together. The datathon is meant to be a collaborative experience where you work alongside a variety of expertises.

## What will we do?

The Data Science Week workshops and datathon are designed to be related but stand-alone experiences. The workshops will cover basic Data Science concepts applicable to any data science projects, using the datathon materials as a case study. During the afternoon practical sessions we will expand on the topics covered in the morning. Usually, this will involve a hands-on walkthrough of the datathon materials. You can follow along and use the scripts as provided, expand and improve upon them, or write your own, all while having BDSi staff on hand to answer your questions.

During the final session, we ask the groups that prepared the best and most interesting models to present their solutions, and the process by which they arrived at them. Finally, the winning team will have the honour of receiving the BDSi Data Science Trophy™!

## Schedule

The Data Science Week will start and end with a group session. You will be free to work on the case on your own schedule, and coaches will be available for questions and feedback throughout. The workshops and seminars are scheduled throughout the week, gradually introducing new topics by creating a baseline solution to datathon.
