Following the large interest of our webinars on Causal Inference, BDSi is organizing a paper reading club on Causal Inference.

We want to give a more extended insight into the field by organizing a paper club. Using the materials and reading list of Brady Neal's [Introduction to Causal Inference course](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course), we will read one paper every two weeks, starting monday May 2nd, 16h30-17h30.

The course covers causal inference from the perspective of machine learning, but is accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of probabilities. More advanced data science topics will pop up during the course, but you should be able to pick these up relatively quickly with the support of the reading club and BDSi staff.
