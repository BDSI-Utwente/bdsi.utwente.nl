    description: Advances in wearable technology have made it possible to continuously track physiological signals such as heart rate variability, skin conductance, and respiration in everyday life. This form of passive sensing provides valuable insights into stress, emotion regulation, and mental health, moving beyond the limitations of laboratory studies. In this talk, I will introduce the principles of ambulatory physiological monitoring, discuss the validity of current measurement techniques, and explore their potential applications in research and clinical practice. While these methods offer exciting opportunities, challenges remain in ensuring data quality, interpreting physiological signals in context, and addressing ethical concerns. By critically examining both the promise and limitations of these tools, we can better understand how to integrate them into studies and applications in a meaningful and responsible way.

## What is the Data Science Week?

The goal of the data science week is to introduce interested students and staff to data science in a fun and cooperative way, and help create a community of data scientists at the University of Twente, the faculty of Behavioural and Management Sciences, and beyond. BDSi and DSI organize various events during the week, including a datathon, contextual speakers, expert lectures, hands-on workshops, and a networking drink.

During the lunch breaks expert data scientists will provide lectures on the most important tools in a data scientists' toolbox; data wrangling, modelling, and communicating results. These lectures will be structured to support the datathon materials, but can be attended without participating in the datathon itself. The lectures are followed by a hands-on practical session in which the lunch lecturerer - supported by a team of motivated coaches - will guide participants in applying the lecture materials to their datathon submissions. 

(Guest) speakers will be invited during the week to provide a deeper background in the topics and methods covered in the lectures and datathon, or to put these topics in a broader context. Throughout the week there will be ample time for socialization and networking, as well as a poster presentation session and networking drink on Thursday afternoon.


{% include card.html title="Signups are now open!" content="You can now sign up for the various lunch talks, the datathon, and the workshops. Places are limited, so sign up now!" cta="Sign up now" cta_link="https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/research/bdsi/data-science-week-2025/" %}

### Datathon

A datathon is an event in which teams collaborate and compete to create a solution to a shared problem. By learning from experts and peers and immediately applying your skills on a relevant and engaging real-world dataset, the BDSi datathons provide a great environment for both students and staff, beginners and experts to further hone their skills. For the spring 2025, we will have a new and rewarding data challenge using physiological data gathered from and by participants. 

### Speakers

(Almost) every lunch break (12:45 - 13:30), expert speakers from across the University of Twente and beyond will give talks on various topics surrounding digital phenotyping. From a broad overview of the roots and likely future of the field, practical applications for social research, to legal and ethical implications - there is something here for everyone to enjoy. All the talks are meant to broaden and enrich the discussion around the data science week, and can be enjoyed with or without participating in the datathon or any of the workshops.

### Lectures & Practicals

In the afternoon (13:45 - 15:30, Tuesday - Friday) expert data scientists from BDSi and our partners will provide a lecture on the most important tools in a data scientists' toolbox; data wrangling, feature engineering, modelling, and communicating results. These lectures will be structured to support the datathon materials, but can be attended without participating in the datathon itself.

After a short coffee break, the lecture will be followed by a hands-on practical session (~14:45 - 15:30). During these this time, the lecturer - supported by a team of motivated coaches - will support participants in applying the lecture materials to their datathon submissions. While these sessions are meant to accompany the days' lecture, they can be attended by any datathon participants. Coaches will be on hand to answer any questions about the days' lecture, the datathon, or data science in general.

### Competition

The team with the best solution will receive the coveted BDSi Data Science trophy. All teams will also be asked to share their solutions, problems, and learning experience during the final presentations. 

## Who can join?

### Staff, students, family, and friends

Everyone related to the University of Twente and their friends and family can join any of the events during the Data Science Week. The lunch talks in particular are meant to be open to everyone who has an interest in the topic. 

The datathon is open to both novices and experts, and everyone in between. You can join as a team, alone, or skip it altogether and only participate in the workshops. As long as one person in the team is affiliated with the University of Twente, you're free (in fact, encouraged!) to invite friends, (external) colleagues, and/or family to join your team. If you do join alone, you can choose to be assigned to a team with other data science enthusiasts, or go at it alone.

## What is required to compete in the datathon?
### Some experience with R or Python

{% include card.html title_element="h3" title="<span style='color: var(--accent-colour, #008eaa);'>Some programming knowledge is required!</span>" content="

<p>You'll need to have a basic idea of either R or Python in order to follow along with the lectures and practicals. Materials will always be prepared for R, and when possible for Python as well.</p>
<p>While we will do our best to introduce data science topics in the various workshops without relying on code, a basic understanding of R and/or Python will make it much easier to follow along.</p>
" %}

<p>If you have some experience with other programming languages, you should be able to follow along with a little preparation. More information on installing and using R can be found in the <a href='#what-can-i-do-to-prepare-for-the-datathon'>What can I do to prepare for the datathon?</a> section.</p>

<p>If you're new to programming in general or would like a deeper understanding of R, and would rather learn from one of our colleagues, the <a href='https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/code/'>Cognition, Data and Education (CoDE)</a> section provides <a href='https://canvas.utwente.nl/courses/4715'>courses and materials aimed at teaching staff</a> and <a href='https://people.utwente.nl/j.steinrucke'>Johannes Steinrücke</a> teaches half-day <a href='https://www.utwente.nl/en/ctd/courses/1897203/introduction-to-r-workshop/'>introduction to R</a> and <a href='https://www.utwente.nl/en/ctd/courses/1897245/data-visualization-using-r-workshop/'>data visualization in R</a> workshops for PhD's (and EngD's).</p>

If you're confident you can participate in the datathon in another programming language, you're more than welcome to do so (we challenge you to try in C, Fortran, [Brainf\*\*\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), or JavaScript). Just be aware that we probably can't offer support if or when you get stuck.

## What can I do to prepare for the datathon?

### Get a team

First off, get a team together. The datathon is meant to be a collaborative experience where you work alongside a variety of expertises. While you can compete on your own, we strongly suggest working together.

### Set up your coding environment

If you're new to data science, you'll want to set up a working environment. We recommend working in R or Python, depending on your experience. 

Install R and RStudio, and prepare a working environment - Our colleague Johannes Steinrücke has written a good [guide on how to set up R and RStudio for your projects](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/m-store/faq/1-faq-start-with-r/), including some practical advice not covered in many other sources. The guide was written for students starting with coursework with R, but is equally applicable for other data science projects.

Install Python - The Women in Data Science team maintains a set of tutorials on installing Python (using Anaconda to manage packages and environments), Jupyter notebooks and the basics of Python data structures: <https://github.com/keikokamei/WiDS_Datathon_Tutorials>.

### Further reading

If you're looking for more information, a competitive edge, or just a good way to spend some time, we can recommend some more reading materials: 

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) is a free to download book providing an excellent introduction to practical machine learning using both R and Python.

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is a free online book compiled by Hadley Wickham and a long list of community contributors, covering the whole gamut of modern data science in R. It is well worth a look, and a good reference even for experienced data scientists.

Kaggle.com provides resources to [get started with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/getting-started-with-kaggle-competitions/notebook), as well as [a long list of competitions that are approachable for beginners](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=5) - with code and discussions available from hundreds of other participants. Trying your hand at a competition or two is a good way to spend a rainy weekend.

[Sharada Kalanidhi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharada-kalanidhi-12430ab2/) has written an excellent deep dive into the 2023 WiDS datathon, including links to further resources for both R and Python: <https://www.widsworldwide.org/get-inspired/blog/a-data-scientists-deep-dive-into-the-wids-datathon/>.
