During social crises like hostage situations, terrorist attacks, and mass shootings, platforms like X are often used by the public and law enforcement to share updates and communicate. However, because this information is publicly accessible, it can also be misused by individuals such as hostage-takers.
In this project, social psychologists and BDSI data analysists will collect microblogging messages shared during various social crises. The next step will involve exploring whether content analysis to identify risky messages can be automated. This research aims to enhance police preparedness for managing social crises in the digital world.
