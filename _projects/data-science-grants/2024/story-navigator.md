The Story Navigator is a computational tool that supports researcher when
analyzing texts. The tool gives the researcher information to easily identify 5
main elements: who is important, what is he/she/it doing, how do the actions
happen, with what purpose and where and when does the story take place.
With the help of BDSi data scientists, a number of requirements are implemented
to contribute to the quality of the analysis: splitting into main and subordinate
clauses, identifying words that refer to the same person or object across the story
and taking negations into account.
