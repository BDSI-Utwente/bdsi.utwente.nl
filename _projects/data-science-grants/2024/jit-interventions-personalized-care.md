This grant proposal seeks to address key challenges in the integration of reinforcement
learning (RL) into app-based mental health interventions, specifically
for the creation of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). The main obstacles
include developing RL algorithms that don't require large datasets, are
resource-efficient on smartphones, and can balance between trying new intervention
strategies and using proven ones. The proposal outlines a collaboration with
the Behavioral Data Science Incubator (BDSI) and the BMSLab to overcome
these challenges by leveraging the BDSI expertise to implement cutting-edge,
innovative RL algorithms suitable for JITAIs within the constraints of existing
app platforms.
