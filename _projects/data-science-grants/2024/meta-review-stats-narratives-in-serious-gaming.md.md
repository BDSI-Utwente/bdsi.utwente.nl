Narratives or stories in serious games can benefit learning because they facilitate motivation and knowledge construction. Narratives also present an essential element in serious games. Here narratives can vary, from providing an interesting background to playing a crucial interactive role in game completion. Moreover, different types of narratives can be distinguished. The presence and type of a narrative may be an influential factor in game-based learning. The envisioned meta-review seeks to offer a comprehensive overview of the relationship between narratives and digital game-based learning, exploring conditions for effectiveness and presenting a research agenda to address unresolved issues in this field.
