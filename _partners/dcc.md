The Digital Competence Center (DCC) is a university-wide network of expertise on data science, research data management, digital research infrastructure, tools and software, and digitalization of science. DCC advocates Open Access and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) research.

BDSi regularly coordinates with the DCC on ongoing research projects, data science events, and workshops - sharing expertise where possible.
