We work closely with the BMS Lab, often collaborating on projects. The BMS lab works to help scientists and students of the social sciences harness the opportunities offered by (new) technologies for research. The lab hosts a wide range of facilities and an even wider range of equipment. This range includes everything from a Virtual Reality (VR) and an EEG lab, to a wide range of sensors and recording equipment.

In a typical collaboration, BMS Lab provides research infrastructure, hardware and software to gather data in a wider range of forms. BDSi then provides the expertise to extract meaning from this data.
